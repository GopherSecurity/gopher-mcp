# MCP C++ SDK Status Report

## Current State (2024-01-23)

### ‚úÖ Working Components

#### Server (mcp_example_server)
- **HTTP Transport**: Fully functional
  - Listens on specified port
  - Handles JSON-RPC requests correctly
  - Responds to all MCP methods (initialize, tools/*, resources/*, prompts/*)
  - Health endpoint working
  - Graceful shutdown with statistics

#### Client (mcp_example_client) 
- **Connection**: Successfully establishes TCP connection
- **Request Sending**: Properly sends HTTP requests with JSON-RPC payloads
- **Port Configuration**: Fixed - now uses correct port from command line

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

#### Client Response Handling
- **Problem**: Client times out waiting for initialize response
- **Root Cause**: Response is sent by server but not processed by client's filter chain
- **Symptoms**:
  - Protocol initialization always times out after 10 seconds
  - Client can send requests but cannot receive responses
  - handleResponse() is never called with server's response

### üìä Test Results

#### Direct Server Testing (curl)
```bash
# All these work correctly:
curl -X POST http://localhost:PORT/rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{...},"id":1}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:PORT/rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{...},"id":2}'
curl http://localhost:PORT/health
```

#### Client-Server Integration
- Connection: ‚úÖ Successful
- Request transmission: ‚úÖ Working  
- Response reception: ‚ùå Not working
- Protocol initialization: ‚ùå Times out

### üîß Recent Fixes

1. **Thread Safety** (#71)
   - Fixed timer creation to happen in dispatcher thread
   - Resolved "Assertion failed: (isThreadSafe())" errors

2. **Port Configuration** (#71)
   - Fixed hardcoded port 8080 issue
   - Client now correctly uses specified port
   - Properly extracts server address from URI

3. **Compilation Errors** (#71)
   - Fixed namespace issues (Response, Request, Notification)
   - Fixed ApplicationBase initialization
   - Added missing method implementations

### üìù Next Steps

To fully fix the client, need to:
1. Debug why FilterManager is not processing incoming HTTP responses
2. Ensure read events are properly enabled after write
3. Verify HttpCodecFilter correctly parses HTTP responses on client side
4. Check if HttpSseJsonRpcProtocolFilter properly extracts JSON-RPC from HTTP body

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

The system uses a layered filter chain architecture:
```
Network Layer ‚Üí FilterManager ‚Üí Protocol Filters ‚Üí Application
                                 ‚îú‚îÄ HttpCodecFilter (HTTP parsing)
                                 ‚îî‚îÄ HttpSseJsonRpcProtocolFilter (JSON-RPC)
```

The issue appears to be in the client-side filter chain not properly handling incoming data after sending a request.
